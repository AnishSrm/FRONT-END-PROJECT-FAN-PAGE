            <p>Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player, best known for managing Manchester United 
                from 1986 to 2013. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time and has won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football.
                 Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time with Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s 
                 with the "Class of '92", who contributed to making the club one of the richest and
                  most successful in the world.[6]</p>
